**University of Pennsylvania, CIS 5650: GPU Programming and Architecture,
Project 1 - Flocking**

* Yuning Wen
  * (TODO) [LinkedIn](), [personal website](), [twitter](), etc (Really sorry but still not ready yet, will update in the future).
* Tested on: Windows 11, i9-12900H @ 2.50GHz 16GB, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Laptop GPU (Personal Laptop)

### README

**1 Late Day used here!**

First of all, a gif for what I've done within this project writing for boids.

#### Analysis

Together with the files I have included a chart with some tested data of different cases collected. Not all of them are finished, but with the partially finished part, I may conclude that less boids does not means they may perform better, and actually when boids are around 50-5000 (in my dataset), the less the boids are, the worse the program performs. 

Also, if the boids and block numbers are the same, uniform grid and coherent grid algorithms will significantly perform better.

(More info WIll update in the future)
